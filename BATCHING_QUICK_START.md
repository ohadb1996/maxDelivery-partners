# 🚀 Delivery Batching - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented?

You can now **batch 2 deliveries together** if they're from the **same business** and their drop-off locations are **within 2 km** of each other!

---

## 🎯 Quick Test (5 Steps)

### 1️⃣ **Business App - Create 2 Deliveries**
```
Login → Create Delivery

Delivery #1:
- Customer: "David Cohen"
- Address: "Dizengoff 100, Tel Aviv"
- Mark as: "מוכן לאיסוף" ✅

Delivery #2:
- Customer: "Sarah Levi"
- Address: "Dizengoff 120, Tel Aviv" 
- Mark as: "מוכן לאיסוף" ✅
```

### 2️⃣ **System Automatically**
- ✅ Geocodes both addresses
- ✅ Saves coordinates to database
- ✅ Calculates distance (120m in this example)

### 3️⃣ **Courier App - See Batch**
```
Login → Dashboard → Scroll down

You'll see:

## 🔧 Customization

Want to change the 2km limit?

**File**: `Dashboard.tsx` (line ~104)
```typescript
const batchOpportunities = findBatchableDeliveries(filteredDeliveries, 2);
//                                                                      ^ Change this!
```

Examples:
- `1` = 1 km (stricter)
- `3` = 3 km (more lenient)
- `5` = 5 km (very lenient)

---

## 🎉 That's It!

Start testing with 2 deliveries from the same business with nearby addresses.

**The system does the rest automatically!** 🚀

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"I don't see batch cards"**
- ✅ Check: Both deliveries from same business?
- ✅ Check: Both marked as "מוכן לאיסוף"?
- ✅ Check: Addresses close enough (< 2km)?
- ✅ Check: Browser console for errors

**"Coordinates not saving"**
- ✅ Check: Internet connection (geocoding needs API)
- ✅ Check: Valid addresses
- ✅ Check: Browser console for geocoding logs

**"Batch accepted but only one delivery showing"**
- ✅ This is normal - ActiveJob page shows active delivery
- ✅ Complete first, second will appear
- ✅ (Future enhancement: Show both at once)
