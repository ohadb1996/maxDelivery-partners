## 🔥 IMPORTANT: Add Firebase Rules

**Before testing, you MUST add database rules!**

### Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Go to**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Your Project** → **Realtime Database** → **Rules**
3. **Add this section**:

```json
"Chats": {
  "$deliveryId": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null",
    "messages": {
      "$messageId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Click "Publish"**
5. **Done!** ✅

**Full guide**: See `CHAT_FEATURE_SETUP.md`
