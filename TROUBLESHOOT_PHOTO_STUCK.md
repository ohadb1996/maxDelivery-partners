                   && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
      allow read: if request.auth != null;

## 📱 **Mobile Specific Issues:**

### **Camera Not Working:**
- Grant camera permissions in browser settings
- Try different browser (Chrome vs Safari)
- Make sure you're on HTTPS (not HTTP)

### **Photo Too Large:**
- Some cameras take 10-20MB photos
- Compression should handle this, but might fail
- Try taking photo in lower quality mode

- Upload might be slow on 3G
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Or switch to WiFi
